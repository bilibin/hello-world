My name's Allen. I'm new to this whole programming thing, but I'm competitive and want to be really good at this.
I'm highly analytical and have the capacity to break down things pretty well. I think it'll help me learn.
One day I'll be skilled enough to work on my own projects, but for now I'm just learning.
